"Affordable Generative Agents (AGA)" is a framework for enabling the generation of believable and low-cost agent-environment and inter-agent interactions. 

This repo is based on [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents). Generative Agents provides a platform that simulates a virtual environment with both front-end and back-end capabilities. 

# How to start a simulation
There's a dedicated documentation for the corresponding environment as follows:
- Backend: [Generative Agents](GA/README.md)
- Frontend:[VirtualHome](VirtualHome/README.md)

## Good To Know
When I red the paper I got very excited but the initial code was only supporting OpenAI. I quickly realized that the cost to just run for a fun moment would have racked cloud bill$, even for an affordable agent 😅. 

So I added support for more cost effective models and start adding features as I learned more about the initial codebase. I have been in the rabbit hole ever since. 🎢 I think this work has a great potential waiting for some creativity and boldness to unlock it. So I am trying.

🧘🏼‍♂️ A good advice for any Internet finding: *I don't know what I am doing* therefore feel encouranged to advice if you have more experience and share your pain if you have less than me. Good luck, to both of us.
